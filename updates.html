<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
25, 2009</u> - 2nd update<br />
</span></p>
<p>Anyone who lost a pet knows how hard it can be. Losing your pet in
tragic circumstances makes the emotional stress even more intense.</p>
<p>Today I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to an animal shelter and
adopted a dog. It's a good dog with calm demeanor and sad eyes, but
looks pretty healthy and nourished, which is important! I decided on
the name "Chunky".&nbsp;<br />
I was told that Chunky was found on the street and probably abandoned
by previous owners. Now Chunky is feeling quite comfortable at my home.
I'm sure we'll get along just fine... oh, I already feel how Chunky can
be of great replacement to my dear lost Fuzzy. </p>
<p>You can see some pictures of Chunky at the <a href="pictures.html">Pictures</a>
section. I hope you'll like Chunky just as I do!
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
25, 2009</u><br />
</span></p>
<p>I decided to address some repeating questions regarding Fuzzy's
demise.&nbsp;My goal was to bring bring Miley back to Twitter, and it
was not
achieved. Since I haven't decided what I should do next, and there's
nothing new to update about at the moment, I've updated the <a
 href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section.</p>
<p>Now, I don't enjoy commenting on speculations and theories, but this
time the levels of ignorance and plain stupidity in people's comments
were so amazing that I find myself responding in bewilderment. If
there's any comfort in this, Fuzzy's death wasn't in vain after all.
This campaign enabled me to learn a great deal about human anatomy as
well. In particular, how little cranial activity&nbsp;a modern <span
 style="font-style: italic;">homo sapiens</span> can have and still
successfully master such nontrivial tasks as going online and putting
letters from the English alphabet into sentences. Thank you, Internet,
for this education!
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
23, 2009</u><br />
</span></p>
<p>Ever since this campaign started, one major question was in the
center of everything - Will Miley save Fuzzy?
<br />
This question has been answered. Sadly, the deadline has passed and
Miley decided not to save Fuzzy. She is not on Twitter, and so Fuzzy is
no longer with us. You can read the full story on <a href="demise.html">Fuzzy's
Demise</a>. Please be advised that the section contains some very
disturbing content and is not recommended for minors or sensitive
people. Read the disclaimer carefully before proceeding!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
17, 2009</u><br />
</span></p>
<p>First of all, you can all relax, for now. Fuzzy is still alive and
well.<br />
Before I explain, allow me to clarify something: <br />
<b>November 22 is now the absolute FINAL deadline. There are no more
ways to extend it.</b></p>
<p>Since day one I've been offering everyone a way to get a one-time
deadline extension through a Trending Topic on Twitter, but it didn't
come to be. In my last update I added a second way to get the same
extension, the Sing for Fuzzy 'contest'. I have since received several
video submissions, some were pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as it turned out, changing the lyrics of a
copyrighted song, re-recording&nbsp;and publishing it, is not perfectly
legal. Like I previously pointed out, I don't want to be
unlawful.&nbsp;I will not be able to go on with the contest as planned
- but since many girls cared enough to make the effort and sing for
Fuzzy, I will grant the extension for their sake.&nbsp;I would
especially like to thank <span style="font-weight: bold;">Katrina</span>
for her beautiful and touching performance. She's my winner and the one
who gets the credit for the extension. However, she eventually decided
not to be publicly revealed, and I respect her decision.</p>
<p> I'll admit to one thing: This extension isn't only for you and for
Fuzzy, it's also for me.&nbsp;I do need some more time. I&nbsp;need
more time with Fuzzy so I can come to terms with having to say goodbye
to
him. I also need more time to make all the necessary arrangements to
ensure
that Fuzzy feels absolutely no pain or even discomfort when the time
comes.</p>
<p>I would like to add that the trending topic offer is now retracted
and no further extensions to the deadline will be possible.
</p>
<p>Once the deadline expires (November 22 at 10PM EST), Fuzzy's fate
will be determined. Assuming nothing changes by then, the actual meal
will probably be prepared the day after it expires. Right now, Miley is
the only one who can stop this from happening. I'm fully prepared to
stay true to my word. Yes, it will be difficult, and yes, I'm happy
that I have more time with Fuzzy, but this must be resolved. Either
way, it will all be over next week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
14, 2009</u><br />
</span></p>
<p>I created a new section called "<a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>'s Response" to keep track of <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>'s comments on the campaign. You can view
it <a href="response.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Come on, <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>! "Your thoughts" are with Fuzzy, but one
just one single tweet could extend his life by a whole week!</p>
<p>Fuzzy and I only hope that of all the girls who volunteered to Sing
for Fuzzy so far, at least one will care enough about Fuzzy to upload
her
song before his deadline expires.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><u>November
12, 2009</u><br />
</span>
<p>As most of you probably know by now, <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>
is now aware of this campaign, and she said that she will not be coming
back to Twitter. This was really difficult for me to hear, and it took
me a long time to get over it.</p>
<p>As of now, this is Fuzzy's last full week ever, as the deadline
remains
November 16. It looks like nobody cares enough about Fuzzy's fate, and
at the moment I do not foresee #mileysavefuzzy becoming a trending
topic. Thus, even that one time extension doesn't seem
quite likely to occur. Or is it?<br />
</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to mention is a weird event that happened not
too long after <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>'s interview (<a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL2XVeOx-YU#t=1m34s"
 target="_blank">the first one</a>) and it gave me some hope. On
November 7, at approximately 6PM EST, <a
 href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>'s original Twitter account (<a
 href="http://twitter.com/mileycyrus" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/mileycyrus</a>)
was suddenly active, complete with her old tweets (except her last one
about leaving), her old background, the people she used to follow, etc.
The only thing missing was her 2+ million followers. She had about
60,000 followers, and the list was growing rapidly in a short period of
time, up to about 75,000 followers.
Many <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWzlD7Lc6w8#t=0m26s"
 target="_blank">Miley</a>
fans that were online at that point also got excited and discussed
it on Twitter.
Shortly afterwards, the account was suspended and a few minutes later
it
went back to being a non-existing page - the same page shown ever since
she
deleted her account. As expected, the fans got disappointed again.
The whole thing went on for about 4 minutes.</p>
<p>This really made me
hopeful, as I found it hard to believe it was a coincidence. I was
hoping Twitter or someone else would explain what exactly happened that
day. The timing, at least, was very interesting.

<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of you seem to be bombarding PETA
and other Animal Rights organizations with spam about MileySaveFuzzy,
but neglecting to actually read their feedback. I decided to
help everyone out, so people can spare their valuable time and help
conserve some network traffic on the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main organizations you've all been
<del>whining</del> complaining to are PETA and The Humane Society.
They both
responded. I took the liberty to bring you their official responses:
</p>
<h3>The Humane Society:</h3>
<blockquote>This is a very disturbing site, obviously, but as of now <b>no
crime has been committed</b>
and likely no crime will end up occurring. Despite claims that this is
&ldquo;not a hoax,&rdquo; most often that is exactly what it is.
Regardless, I have
passed this site along to our Director of Animal Cruelty Issues to see
what steps, if any, can be taken.
  <p>Sadly, <b>animal cruelty is a crime that really isn&rsquo;t an
offense until it occurs- threatening is not criminal</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>PETA:</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> (Short version: We can't do
anything, contact the Chinese ambassador)</span><br />
<blockquote>
  <p>Hello,</p>
  <p>Thank you for contacting PETA with your concerns regarding
MileySaveFuzzy.com.</p>
  <p>Sadly, some people regard the Internet as a medium for sick jokes.
Often, those who develop or contribute to hostile or otherwise abusive
Web sites do so simply to draw attention with offensive content. Of
course, such sites are in very poor taste but, unfortunately, <b>are
usually legal</b>.</p>
  <p>Since these heartless people are encouraged by attention, the most
effective way to discourage them is to avoid visiting their sites and
to
urge others to do the same. To learn more about actions you can take in
response to Web sites depicting cruelty to animals, see <a
 href="http://www.peta.org/actioncenter/onlinecruelty.asp"
 target="_blank">http://www.PETA.org/actioncenter/onlinecruelty.asp</a>.</p>
  <p>Only seven states in the U.S. have laws against eating dogs and
cats.
Please write to your local and state lawmakers and urge them to ban
this
practice. For letter-writing tips, please see <a
 href="http://www.helpinganimals.com/res_letterWriting.asp"
 target="_blank">http://www.HelpingAnimals.com/res_letterWriting.asp</a>.
For instructions on
lobbying, please see <a
 href="http://www.helpinganimals.com/Factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=74"
 target="_blank">http://www.helpinganimals.com/Factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=74</a>.</p>
  <p>You can also help by writing letters to prime ministers,
agriculture
ministers, and ambassadors of countries that have live-animal markets,
including China and South Korea. Urge them to develop enforceable
animal
protection laws that explicitly prohibit beating, hanging,
electrocuting, burning, scalding, and torturing dogs and cats in other
ways both before and during slaughter.</p>
  <p>If killing cats and dogs for food upsets you, please remember that
the
billions of cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals more commonly
raised
and slaughtered for food also suffer terribly. PETA fights to protect
all animals from being killed for their flesh and encourages people to
adopt a vegan diet. To learn more, please visit <a
 href="http://www.goveg.com/" target="_blank">http://www.GoVeg.com</a>.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your compassion for animals.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>The PETA Staff</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sorry, guys, but only Miley can save

</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A week after MileySaveFuzzy.com has
gone online, I'm delighted to present my very first followup. Before I
go on, I'd like to thank everyone who took their time to promote
#mileysavefuzzy on Twitter, publish stories, send descriptive feedback
by email, post videos on YouTube and more! You guys are helping to do a
good thing and together we will succeed! I find it reassuring that I am
not the only one interested in saving Fuzzy's life!<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I've been asked a lot of
questions, I decided to publish a small <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> to
sort some things out. I
hope you will forgive me for not being able to disclose many details
that some of you find curious, such as my age and whereabouts, but I
don't think it matters!<br />
