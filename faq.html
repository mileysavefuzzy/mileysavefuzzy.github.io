<h2 style="text-align: justify;">FAQ</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Why are you doing this?<br />
</span>A: As previously stated, I
was devastated by Miley's decision to
quit Twitter. I don't consider myself a fanatic and could live with
Miley not tweeting as often as I'd like... but the news of her sudden
and abrupt account termination were just too shocking for me to handle.
A world without Miley's tweets just seems bleak and pointless to me.
The decision to cook Fuzzy was induced by desperation. Miley's tweets
to me are like a source of light gone dim. This is the only way I can
think of to bring back some of the lost light into my world!<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Are you an animal
abuser?</span><br />
A: NO! I would never think of causing Fuzzy any unnecessary pain or
discomfort. I have spent days trying to figure out how to put Fuzzy to
death by the quickest, most painless means possible. I even considered
giving him a sedative. Of course, the idea is to cook a meal, so such
sedative must have no impact on taste or toxic levels of Fuzzy's meat.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Aren't you, in fact,
blackmailing/bullying Miley into tweeting again?</span><br />
A: Again, NO! That's definitely not the way I see it! I made the
decision to cook my cat, this is something that has impact on my life
and Fuzzy's. Miley indeed has the power to put an immediate end to my
plans and save Fuzzy's life, but it remains her choice whether to do
so. If Miley doesn't care about Fuzzy's fate, she can just ignore us
both and move on with her life! <br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Aren't you worried
about legal issues?</span><br />
A:&nbsp; Well, naturally I thought of that. As far as I know, I'm
not
breaking any law. If and when I'm contacted by any legitimate
authority, and discover that I am in violation of law, I will consult
with professionals and do my best to cooperate and remedy the situation.<br />
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">After
Fuzzy's Demise</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
How could you eat an
animal that has been euthanized? Weren't you affected by the euthanasia
drug in Fuzzy's meat?</span><br />
A: Most euthanasia drugs, such as&nbsp;<b>Pentobarbital</b>,
have a short span of activity. Also, their effect mainly depends on the
mass of the recipient. Fuzzy's weight was approximately 4.5 kg. The
portion of the drug in the parts of his flesh used for Fried Cat Strips
was, if at all present, a mere fraction of the total amount injected
into his body. Taking our weight differences into consideration, the
total effect of this on my physiology was never supposed to be anything
other than negligible. As a matter of fact, at the moment I'm feeling
perfectly fine and I'm glad to report no aberrations in my health
condition, not even an intestinal disorder of any kind! But I do
appreciate the concern many of you showed for me!<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Look! It's not the
same cat! That one had stripes, this one has dots!</span><br />
A: I'm not even sure how to answer this. It's the same cat, and if you
can't see it, well, I'm not sure how I can help you besides suggesting
to take a better look, particularly on his face. You may also notice
that the camera angles were slightly different. For example, his belly
wasn't shown on any of the early pics. In any case, people who claim
it's not the same cat are also the people who claim Fuzzy looked abused
on his first pics. Like I said, you can't help everyone.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:&nbsp;He's
just
sleeping!</span><br />
A: I'm sure it's difficult for most of
you to fathom what happened, and
I figured some people may choose to believe it's just a sleeping Fuzzy.
If it makes you sleep better at night, believe what you wish. In a way,
Fuzzy is sleeping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:
Why haven't you posted
any pics of the meal you made? Or any pics of Fuzzy being prepared in
the kitchen? Have you chickened out?<br />
</span>A: I didn't want to spell it
out for you, but
I guess there's no harm in doing that now. I have two words for you:
