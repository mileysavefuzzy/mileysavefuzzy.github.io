<h2>Welcome to Miley Save Fuzzy</h2>
<a href="updates.html"><u>GREAT NEWS! I now have a dog!</u></a>
<p><b>* Fuzzy is dead. Check the <a href="updates.html">Updates</a>
page.
Full story is on a new page: <a href="demise.html">Fuzzy's Demise</a>.</b>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Make sure you
read the disclaimer before you proceed!</span><br />
<b>The following text is no longer entirely relevant, as the deadline

</p>
<p>Like many others, I became addicted to Miley Cyrus' Tweeting.
Catching up with her daily chores and what she has in mind have become
part of my daily routine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You could imagine how painfully shocking it was to learn that Miley
will be quitting Twitter for ever - especially for a silly reason I
can't even remember, but it goes along the lines of her boyfriend not
having a Twitter or something like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day&nbsp;I asked myself: 'What can I do to bring Miley
back to Twitter?' Fan video? Petitions? Letters? That never works.
Heck, Miley even made her own video about never wanting to use Twitter
again. Then I looked at my cat Fuzzy and I realized, maybe Fuzzy can
help. Fuzzy can make the ultimate sacrifice for this cause. It was very
difficult for me, you see, as I sincerely love Fuzzy. But my mind is
made up. I could always get another cat, but nothing can replace
Miley's tweets for me!</p>
<p><!-- <img src="test.jpg" height="100" width="125" class="left" alt="" /> -->The
idea is very simple. I've set a deadline of <del><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">November 16, 2009</span></del> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="updates.html">November 22, 2009</a></span>,
when Fuzzy will
part with his life and become a meal. I intend to make a cat dish
according to our ethnic cuisine.&nbsp;Check out the <a
 href="recipes.html">Recipes</a> section for more information. Also,
you can view some pictures of Fuzzy <a href="pictures.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself a cruel person and I do love my cat. Fuzzy
will receive quick and swift death and I'll try to minimize his
suffering. As a disclaimer I must say that most recipes require to
behead or suffocate the cat and then rapidly pluck and dress it.
Unfortunately I have no experience with that so I really hope I won't
hurt Fuzzy too much... but I'm sure eventually everything will be okay!
As soon as the meal is prepared and eaten, I will update the Pictures
section with photos of the resulting meal, as well as some notes and
impressions from someone who had a first cat-based meal in life.</p>
<h3>How can Fuzzy be saved?</h3>
<p>Simple. Miley Cyrus needs to come back to&nbsp;Twitter. At least
occasionally. I respect her position, and do not mean to pressure her
to do anything against her will! But still... She just can't give
something so great to the world and then take it back completely, just
like that! Besides, it doesn't have to affect her life in a bad way.
She can just tweet whenever she feels like it. I do want her to be
somewhat active, however. The deal is basically this: <b>if Miley
reopens her account sometime between now and <del>November 16, 2009 at
10PM
EST</del> <a href="updates.html">November 22, 2009 at 10PM
EST</a>, Fuzzy's life will be spared.</b> However, just reopening the
account is not enough. I want to make sure she's active again (even if
she's less active than before, that's her choice). Which is why, at
first, every time Miley tweets, Fuzzy's cooking deadline extends by <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">one week</span>. After I see she's pretty
much active again and she's making several tweets on a somewhat regular
basis, the idea of cooking Fuzzy will be abandoned and Fuzzy will live
on for the rest of his natural days.<!-- <img src="test.jpg" class="right" height="100" width="125"  alt="" /> --></p>
<p>Let me clarify: This is NOT a prank or a hoax. I am not joking, even
if some will choose to interpret it that way. Cooking a cat is not
illegal in my country, in fact it's part of our culture. I'm not asking
for money or any other benefit. Fuzzy is my cat and I will not
entertain any offers of selling or giving him away. If Miley doesn't
tweet again, this WILL happen, and I'm as serious as a heart attack.</p>
<p>I hope Miley comes through. I'm sure she already considers coming
back anyway.</p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Fuzzy's life is hanging by a thread and will end if I do not achieve
my goal. Ultimately, Miley is the only one who has the power to save
Fuzzy. <del>However, you may be able to temporarily extend the
deadline.</del> You
can help by spreading the word around. Talk about Fuzzy, tweet about
Fuzzy (use the <u>#mileysavefuzzy</u> hashtag), raise awareness. <del>The
most important thing is making sure Miley knows about this.</del></p>
<p><b><a href="response.html">UPDATE: She knows</a></b></p>
<p> <del>To keep
you motivated, <b>for one time only, in order to help and raise
awareness, if #mileysavefuzzy becomes a trending topic on Twitter, the
deadline will extend by one week</b>.</del> (Deadline extended to
November 22, this will no longer extend the deadline)</p>
<p>After that, it's up to Miley.
